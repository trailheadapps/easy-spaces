## Features

A quick overview of the features you can explore in Easy Spaces:

*  Modular app design and Unlocked Packages
*  Lightning Console APIs & Navigation Methods
*	Lightning Flow
	*  Dynamic flow interview components
	*  Custom flow screen components
	*  Local Action components
* 	Custom Lightning Page Templates
*	Lightning Themes and Design Token Bundles
* 	Custom Metadata Types


## Code Highlights

### Dynamic Flows and Local Action Components

The **spaceDesigner** and **reservationHelper** components render flow interviews dynamically, by using the **lightning:flow** base component. You can see the **customerDetails** and **smartGallery** components at work as screens in these dynamic flows. Both of these components use the functionality of the **lightning:availableForFlowScreens** interface to control flow navigation actions.

See this [blog post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2018/06/announcing-the-easy-spaces-app.html) for more detail about custom flow navigation and dynamic flow interviews.

Components used as Lightning Flow screens also enforce a convention in the markup of their design files, to help developers better track how attributes are being used by flow interviews. See the [customerDetails](./es-space-mgmt/main/default/aura/customerDetails/customerDetails.design) and [smartGallery](./es-space-mgmt/main/default/aura/smartGallery/smartGallery.design) component design files for examples.

### Object-Agnostic Design

The **customerList** and **customerTile** components can display information from Contact objects or Lead objects.

![Two instances of customerList component on canvas in Lightning App Builder](./docs/customerList_view.png)

The customerList component uses a design attribute to allow for users working in Lightning App Builder to control which object an instance of the component should display:

![customerList component design attribute as picklist in Lightning App Builder](./docs/customerList_design.png)

This is just one example of object-agnostic design at work in Easy Spaces. See this [blog post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2018/06/announcing-the-easy-spaces-app.html) for more detail about this pattern.

### Control Navigation and Behavior in Console Apps

Easy Spaces uses the Lightning Console JavaScript API to control navigation and behaviors of tabs and subtabs in the Space Management console app. You can see the lightning:workspaceAPI component at work in the **openRecordAction** component, which enables flow interviews to navigate users to a new subtab. The **reservationHelper** and **spaceDesigner** components use the lightning:navigationItemAPI component to refresh custom Lightning Page tabs in the background as a user works. You can get more detail about using the Workspace API in your components in this [blog post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2018/06/announcing-the-easy-spaces-app.html).

### Modular Design and Unlocked Packaging

Easy Spaces illustrates how to organize application metadata into granular units or modules. This approach is reflected in the design patterns at work throughout the application, like the use of design tokens and object-agnostic components. But you'll also see this at work in the structure of the Easy Spaces repo itself.

The Easy Spaces application is made of several, interdependent unlocked packages. The dependecies between the Easy Spaces packages are listed in the [sfdx-project.json](./sfdx-project.json) file for this repo.

You can also explore the contents of each package by looking at the related package folder within this repo. The `path` attribute entries in the sfdx-project.json show which folder contains the metadata for a particular package.

For more about how the Easy Spaces metadata is organized into package modules, check out [this post](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2018/06/working-with-modular-development-and-unlocked-packages-part-2.html).
